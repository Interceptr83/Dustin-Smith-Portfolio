                        <article>
                            <p>I started with a background in coding in High School. Learning HTML, CSS, Basic, Pascal and C++ with the goal of wanting to get into game design. After graduation I worked for a small web development company for a short period but ended up getting drawn into working for my family business in car and RV sales.</p>
                            <p>After 20 years in the sales field where I had never really been happy, I decided it was time to change directions and go back to what I had always wanted to be doing. Working in coding.</p>
                            <p>So now I'm in the process of completeing the Full Stack Web Development course at UC Irvine to start moving back into the coding field.</p>

                                brand.<br><br>
                                Online Sales Manager, Adventure RV/Napa Auto Center, Napa, CA<br>
                                June 2002 — February 2019<br>
                                This was my family business. I started working here immediately after High
                                School. I started with selling cars. Over the years I took on more responsibility
                                starting with managing all of the dealerships online presence. Eventually moving
                                more into a leadership role at the dealership. Being a family business this
                                required wearing almost every "hat". From acting as a service manager, F&I,
                                handling warranty processing, managing employees ect. I was also responsible
                                for choosing which back end systems, CRM systems, and pretty much any other
                                technology based items that the dealership needed. After about 10 years of being
                                a car dealership we decided to switch focus and while we maintained a small lot
                                of used vehicles we focused primarily on becoming a new RV dealership. I left
                                because my father wanted to retire and I was frustrated with the RV industry.
                                This combined with a desire to move away from Napa led to my choice to not
                                take over the dealership and move in another direction. So we sold the business
                                and I moved to Southern California.<br><br>
                                Website project manager, Genacom, Napa, CA<br>
                                November 2003 — August 2004<br>
                                This position was to act as both sales and project manager for web site
                                construction. I was the primary point of contact with the client while being
                                responsible for distributing different aspects of the construction to assorted
                                subcontractors to develop. Then putting those individual pieces together to
                                complete the final product.<br><br>

                                August 2002 — December 2003<br>
                                After High School I started attending college with the attention of getting a degree
                                in computer science. However I was offered job position at a web development
                                company by a former teacher and with that new position combined with still
                                working part time for my family business this left me little time to continue with
                                school.<br><br>
