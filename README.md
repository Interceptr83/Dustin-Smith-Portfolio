# Overview
---------------
 This is my portfolio page. I used standard html, css, and javascript along with the bootstrap, jquery, and iconify libraries as well. I used jquery to create transforming navigation as well as a jquery accordian to display the content in a more dynamic way than just scrolling. I also used an GitHub API call to dynamically add in links to my GitHub repositories.
