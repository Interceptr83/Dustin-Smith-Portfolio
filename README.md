# Overview
---------------
 This is my portfolio page. I used standard html, css, and javascript along with the bootstrap, jquery, and iconify libraries as well. I used jquery to create transforming navigation as well as a jquery accordian to display the content in a more dynamic way than just scrolling. I also used an GitHub API call to dynamically add in links to my GitHub repositories.

# Requirements
---------------
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work<br>
WHEN I load their portfolio<br>
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them - DONE<br>
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation<br>
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section - DONE<br>
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work<br>
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications - DONE<br>
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application<br>
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others - IN PROGRESS<br>
WHEN I click on the images of the applications<br>
THEN I am taken to that deployed application - DONE<br>
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices<br>
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport - ALMOST<br>
